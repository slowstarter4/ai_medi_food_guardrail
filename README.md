# Medication & Food Safety Guardrail System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build an AI-based guardrail system that analyzes
prescriptions and food/nutrition labels to detect potential medication–food
interaction risks and provide preventive guidance.

## 🎯 Scope
- Input: Prescription images, food/nutrition label images
- Core functions:
  - OCR-based text extraction
  - NLP-based information structuring
  - Rule-based risk detection
  - User-facing warning messages
- This system does NOT provide medical diagnosis.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- OCR: (TBD)
- NLP: LLM-based text structuring
- Rule-based logic for risk detection
- Simple UI / visualization

## 👥 Team Roles
- NLP: Text structuring & pipeline design
- Computer Vision: OCR
- Data Analysis: Risk case definition
- Planning: User scenarios & messaging

## 📅 Timeline
- Total duration: ~7–8 weeks
